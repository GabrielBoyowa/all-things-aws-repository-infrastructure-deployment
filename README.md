This repository is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security showcase, demonstrating how 
<span style="color:#D13212; font-weight:600;">robust, production-grade security frameworks</span> 
can be embedded across a wide spectrum of AWS architectural patterns. Built with Terraform, the project translates 
<span style="color:#D13212; font-weight:600;">industry-standard security guardrails</span> 
into reusable, auditable code—spanning everything from legacy, monolithic three-tier architectures to modern serverless and fully managed cloud-native environments.

<br><br>

At its core, this portfolio highlights 
<span style="color:#1D8102; font-weight:600;">Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)</span> 
in action. Each module reveals how 
<span style="color:#1D8102; font-weight:600;">automated compliance</span>, 
<span style="color:#1D8102; font-weight:600;">continuous monitoring</span>, and 
<span style="color:#1D8102; font-weight:600;">defence-in-depth best practices</span> 
are systematically enforced across AWS’s foundational pillars: Compute, Network, and Storage.

<strong>Development Note:</strong> To preserve the security integrity of this showcase, all sensitive backend configurations and environment-specific metadata are deliberately excluded via <code>.gitignore</code>.
