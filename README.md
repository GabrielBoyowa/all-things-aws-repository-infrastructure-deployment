This repository serves as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) showcase, demonstrating the implementation of security frameworks across a variety of AWS architectural patterns. Using Terraform, this project codifies industry-standard security guardrails for diverse environments—ranging from legacy monolithic three-tier setups to modern serverless and fully managed ecosystems.


The primary focus of this portfolio is to illustrate Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM). 
By exploring these modules, you can witness how automated compliance, monitoring and defensive in depth best practices are applied to core AWS pillars: Compute, Network, and Storage.


Development Note: To maintain the security integrity of this showcase, all sensitive backend configuration files and environment metadata are excluded via .gitignore.
