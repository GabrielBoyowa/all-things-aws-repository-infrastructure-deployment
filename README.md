This repository is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security showcase**, demonstrating how **pre-production-grade security frameworks** can be embedded across a wide spectrum of AWS architectural patterns. Built with **Terraform**, the project translates **industry-standard security guardrails** into reusable, auditable code—spanning everything from legacy, monolithic three-tier architectures to modern serverless and fully managed cloud-native environments.

At its core, this portfolio highlights **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)** principles in action. Each module illustrates how **automated compliance**, **continuous monitoring**, and **defence-in-depth best practices** are systematically applied across AWS’s foundational pillars: **Compute**, **Network**, and **Storage**.

**Development Note:** To preserve the security integrity of this showcase, all sensitive backend configurations and environment-specific metadata are deliberately excluded via `.gitignore`.
